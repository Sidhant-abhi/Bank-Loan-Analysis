### ⏩Situation:

At Bank , Despite managing a diverse portfolio of loans, our financial

institution faces challenges in effectively analyzing and monitoring loan

performance due to the increasing complexity of financial markets and the

limitations of traditional data analysis methods.

There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that provides real-

time insights into our loan portfolio, enabling proactive risk management,

portfolio optimization, and timely decision-making to maintain

competitiveness and ensure sustained profitability.

### ⏩Task:

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing these trends to identify areas for improvement and suggest data-driven recommendations.

### ⏩Action:

I leveraged the loan report dashboards to conduct a deep dive into loan applications, approvals, purposes, and terms. This analysis provided insights into borrower behavior and loan product preferences.

### ⏩Result:

Based on the data, I recommended the following:

✅ Streamlining the loan approval process to maintain efficiency as

applications rise.

✅ Developing targeted debt consolidation solutions with competitive rates

to attract this key borrower segment.

✅ Promoting mortgage products and services through targeted marketing

campaigns to capitalize on strong demand.

✅ Analyzing the shift towards longer loan terms to understand borrower

motivations and tailor loan offerings accordingly.
